(Submitter supplied) The development of antibiotic tolerance is believed to be a major factor in the lengthy duration of current tuberculosis therapies. In the current study, we have modeled antibiotic tolerance in vitro by exposing Mycobacterium tuberculosis to two distinct stress conditions: progressive hypoxia and nutrient starvation [phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)]. We then studied the bacterial transcriptional response using RNA-seq and employed a bioinformatics approach to identify important transcriptional regulators, which was facilitated by a novel Regulon Enrichment Test (RET). more...",GSM2803959,ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2803nnn/GSM2803959,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,SRX3243874,rpoB-7H9,DRonA classified non-viable

(Submitter supplied) The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome encodes two complete high-affinity Pst phosphate-specific transporters. We previously demonstrated that a membrane-spanning component of one Pst system, PstA1, was essential both for M. tuberculosis virulence and for regulation of gene expression in response to external phosphate availability. To determine if the alternative Pst system is similarly required for virulence or gene regulation, we constructed a deletion of pstA2. more...",GSM2219046,ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM2219nnn/GSM2219046,Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv; Mycobacterium tuberculosis str.

(Submitter supplied) Unlike many pathogens that are overtly harmful to their hosts, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can persist for years within humans in a clinically latent state. Latency is often linked to hypoxic conditions within the host. Among M. tuberculosis genes induced by hypoxia is a putative transcription factor, Rv3133c/DosR. We performed targeted disruption of this locus followed by transcriptome analysis of wild-type and mutant bacilli. more...",GSM219331,ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM219nnn/GSM219331,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,dnf,Cell culture grew under any treatment (channel 1) Cell culture grew under 0.2% Oxygen treatment (channel 2),DRonA classified non-viable

(Submitter supplied) An estimated two billion persons are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The host factors that initiate and maintain this latent state and the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis survives within latent lesions are compelling but unanswered questions. One such host factor may be nitric oxide (NO), a product of activated macrophages that exhibits antimycobacterial properties. Evidence for the possible significance of NO comes from murine models of tuberculosis showing progressive infection in animals unable to produce the inducible isoform of NO synthase and in animals treated with a NO synthase inhibitor. more...",GSM886314,dnf,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,dnf,1254 No treatment (channel 1) Highaerationand0.005mMDNO (channel 2),DRonA classified non-viable
