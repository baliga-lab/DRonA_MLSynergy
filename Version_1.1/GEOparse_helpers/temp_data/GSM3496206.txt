1. Transcriptional profiling of M. tuberculosis treated with DG167 and INH
(Submitter supplied) We report that combined treatment with both DG167 and INH activates a cellular response associated with loss of persistence and induction of cidality that is distinct from the cellular response induced by single drug treatment.
