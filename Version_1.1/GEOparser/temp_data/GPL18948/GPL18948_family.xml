      <Treatment-Protocol>
One hundred eighty uL of exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000　× g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Precultures were prepared by shaking -80 °C glycerol stocked parent and evolved resistant strains in 200 uL of modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates for 23 h at 34 °C without antibiotic. The cells precultured were diluted to an OD600 nm of 1　× 10^-4 into 200 uL of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates. Then, cultures were grown with shaking at 34 °C to an OD600 in the 0.072 ~ 0.135 range (equivalent of 10 generations).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was isolated and purified from cells using an RNeasy micro kit with on-column DNA digestion (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of 9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.  After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
One hundred eighty uL of exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000　× g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Precultures were prepared by shaking -80 °C glycerol stocked parent and evolved resistant strains in 200 uL of modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates for 23 h at 34 °C without antibiotic. The cells precultured were diluted to an OD600 nm of 1　× 10^-4 into 200 uL of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates. Then, cultures were grown with shaking at 34 °C to an OD600 in the 0.072 ~ 0.135 range (equivalent of 10 generations).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
One hundred eighty uL of exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000　× g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Precultures were prepared by shaking -80 °C glycerol stocked parent and evolved resistant strains in 200 uL of modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates for 23 h at 34 °C without antibiotic. The cells precultured were diluted to an OD600 nm of 1　× 10^-4 into 200 uL of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates. Then, cultures were grown with shaking at 34 °C to an OD600 in the 0.072 ~ 0.135 range (equivalent of 10 generations).

Total RNA was isolated and purified from cells using an RNeasy micro kit with on-column DNA digestion (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of 9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were precultured for 60 hours under the same condition with the laboratory with or without the corresponding stressors. Then, 5×10e7 cells in the exponential growth phase were used to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were precultured for 60 hours under the same condition with the laboratory with or without the corresponding stressors. Then, 5×10e7 cells in the exponential growth phase were used to transcriptome analysis.

Exponential cultures were withdrawn rapidly, and cells were killed immediately by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold ethanol that contained 10% (w/v) phenol. The cells were collected by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at −80 °C prior to RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were precultured for 60 hours under the same condition with the laboratory with or without the corresponding stressors. Then, 5×10e7 cells in the exponential growth phase were used to transcriptome analysis.

Two volumes of RNA Protect bacterial reagent (Qiagen) were added directly to one volume of the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000×g for 10 min at 25°C, and total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA was treated with DNase I at room temperature for 15 min. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of 8.4 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
MDS42 and the evolved strains cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 5 ml of modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultivated overnight at 34°C at 150 rpm. The overnight cultures were diluted to an OD600 of 0.1 into fresh modified M9 medium in test tubes and cultured.

      <Extract-Protocol>
An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

After confirmation of yields (&gt; 825 ng) and specific activities (&gt; 15 pmol/μg) of the Cy3-labbeled cRNAs using NanoDrop ND-2000, 600 ng of Cy3-labelled cRNA was fragmented at 60°C for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 25 ul containing 1x Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2x Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturer's instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 25 ul of 2x GE Hybridization Buffer HI-RPM was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to custom designed the Agilent 8× 60K arrays for E. coli W3110, E.coli_K12_Expression_Ver.1, for 17 hours at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37°C GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately.

Cells were inoculated from the frozen glycerol stock into 96-well microplates containing 200 µl of modified M9 medium without chemicals used for laboratory evolution and cultivated 24h at 34°C with agitation at 900 rotations/min. The precultures were diluted to an OD620 of 0.000033-0.0004 into 200 µl of fresh modified M9 medium in 96-well microplates and cultured. After 12 to 21 h incubation, the exponentially growing cultures (OD600 in the 0.072-0.135 range) were harvested for total RNA extraction.

An equal volume of ice-cold ethanol containing 10% (w/v) phenol was added directly to the exponentially growing cultures to stabilize cellular RNA. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min, and the pelleted cells were stored at –80°C before RNA extraction. Total cellular RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified RNA samples were stores at – 80°C before microarray experiments. The quality of the purified RNA was evaluated using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with an RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent Technologies). Only purified RNAs that had RIN (RNA integrity number) of9.0 or more were utilized. The purified RNAs were stored at −80°C prior to transcriptome analysis.

    <Title>Prediction of antibiotic resistance by large-scale phenotypic and genotypic data</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>25517437</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The evolution of antibiotic resistance is a clear example of adaptation by natural selection. Although a number of mutations contributing to the resistance have been identified, the relationship between the mutations and the related phenotypic changes responsible for the resistance has yet to be fully elucidated. To better characterize phenotype-genotype mapping for drug resistance, we performed parallel laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli under the selection of single antibiotics and after 90 days propagation obtained resistant strains. We find that an acquisition of resistance to one drug drastically changes the resistance and susceptibility to other drugs. Based on transcriptome data of these strains, we demonstrated that the resistances could be quantitatively predicted by the expression changes of a small number of genes. Whole-genome resequencing analysis provided several candidate mutations contributing to the resistances, while phenotype-genotype mapping was suggested to be complex and included various mutations that caused similar phenotypic changes. The integration of transcriptome and genome data enables us to extract essential phenotypic changes for drug resistances.

    <Overall-Design>
To examine the contribution of the gene expression changes to the antibiotic resistances, transcriptome of the parent strain (duplicated) and 40 resistant strains (4 parallel-evolved resistant strains for 10 antibiotics) were analyzed.

    <Title>Prediction of Cross-resistance and Collateral Sensitivity by Gene Expression profiles and Genomic Mutations.</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>29070832</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
In adaptive evolution, an increase in fitness to an environment is frequently accompanied by changes in fitness to other environmental conditions, called cross-resistance and sensitivity. Although the networks between fitness changes affect the course of evolution substantially, the mechanisms underlying such fitness changes are yet to be fully elucidated. Herein, we performed high-throughput laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli under various stress conditions using an automated culture system, and quantified how the acquisition of resistance to one stressor alters the resistance to other stressors. We demonstrated that resistance changes could be quantitatively predicted based on changes in the transcriptome of the resistant strains. We also identified several genes and gene functions, for which mutations were commonly fixed in the strains resistant to the same stress, which could partially explain the observed cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity. The integration of transcriptome and genome data enabled us to clarify the bacterial stress resistance mechanisms.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To examine the contribution of the gene expression changes to the stress resistances, transcriptome of the parent strain (triplicated) and 55 resistant strains (5 parallel-evolved resistant strains for 11 stresses) were analyzed.

    <Title>High-throughput identification of the impact of ΔrecA mutation on sensitivities to various chemical compounds in Escherichia coli</Title>

    <Summary>
Antibiotic resistance is currently considered as a global threat to public health. It was shown that adaptive resistance mutation and acquisition of resistance genes by horizontal gene transfer are facilitated by RecA-dependent SOS response during antibiotic treatment. In this study, we performed high-throughput determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 214 chemicals including not only various kinds of antibiotics but also toxic chemicals of unknown drug action in Escherichia coli wild-type MDS42 strain and the ΔrecA mutant strain. The ΔrecA mutant showed increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, DNA replication inhibitors, and chromate stress. The ΔrecA mutant also showed increased sensitivity to chemicals other than DNA-damaging agents such as S-(2-aminoethyl)- l-cysteine, l-histidine, ruthenium red, D-penicillamine, carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), cerulenin, and l-cysteine. Microarray analysis showed that expressions of glnK, nac, and glnLG encoding nitrogen assimilation regulators together with amtB encoding ammonium transporter decreased in the ΔrecA mutant strain. These results suggest that ΔrecA mutation affect not only SOS response but also nitrogen assimilation.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Transcriptomes of the ΔrecA mutant strain and the wild-type strain were compared by DNA microarray analysis. Both strains were grown on the modified M9 medium and total RNA was isolated from the cells in the early exponential growth phase. The comparison was performed in triplicate, starting from independent cultures.

    <Summary>
Understanding constraints which shape antibiotic resistance is key for predicting and controlling drug resistance. Here, we performed high-throughput laboratory evolution of Escherichia coli. The transcriptome, resistance, and genomic profiles for the evolved strains in 48 environments were quantitatively analyzed. By analyzing the quantitative datasets through interpretable machine learning techniques, the emergence of low dimensional phenotypic states within the 192 strains was observed. Further analysis revealed the underlying biological processes responsible for the distinct states. We also report a novel constraint which leads to decelerated evolution. These findings bridge the genotypic, gene expression, and drug resistance space, and lead to a comprehensive understanding of constraints for antibiotic resistance.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Transcriptomes of the 192 evolved strains and the wild-type strain were compared by DNA microarray analysis. All strains were grown on the modified M9 medium and total RNA was isolated from the cells in the exponential growth phase.
